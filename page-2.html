    <h3  class="whatAre">What are GMO's?</h3>
    <p   id="page-2.html"class="p1"> A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. Bacteria are the easiest organisms to engineer and have been used for research, food production, industrial protein purification (including drugs), agriculture, and art. There is potential to use them for environmental, purposes or as medicine. Fungi have been engineered with much the same goals. Plants have been engineered for scientific research, to create new colors in plants, deliver vaccines and to create enhanced crops. Genetically modified crops are publicly the most controversial GMOs. The majority are engineered for herbicide tolerance or insect resistance. Golden rice has been engineered with three genes that increase its nutritional value.</p> <a  class="btt1" href="stupid-science-gmo-thing.html">back to main page</a>
