<h3 class="howAre">How are GMO's made?</h3>
    <p id="page-3.html" class="p2">Creating a genetically modified organism (GMO) is a multi-step process. Genetic engineers must isolate the gene they wish to insert into the host organism. This gene can be taken from a cell or artificially synthesized. If the chosen gene or the donor organism's genome has been well studied it may already be accessible from a genetic library. The gene is then combined with other genetic elements, including a promoter and terminator region and a selectable marker. As only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be regenerated from that single cell.</p>
