    <p id="page-5.html"class="p4">Food products from genetically modified bacteria include alpha-amylase, which converts starch to simple sugars, chymosin, which clots milk protein for cheese making, and pectinesterase, which improves fruit juice clarity. Plants have been engineered for scientific research, to display new flower colors, deliver vaccines and to create enhanced crops. Tobacco was the first plant to be genetically modified. Genetically modified crops are genetically modified plants that are used in agriculture. The first crops developed were used for animal or human food and provide resistance to certain pests, diseases, environmental conditions, spoilage or chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a herbicide). The second generation of crops aimed to improve the quality, often by altering the nutrient profile. Third generation genetically modified crops could be used for non-food purposes, including the production of pharmaceutical agents, biofuels, and other industrially useful goods, as well as for bioremediation. The process of genetically engineering mammals is slow, tedious, and expensive. However, new technologies are making genetic modifications easier and more precise. Genetically modified fish are used for scientific research, as pets and as a food source. In biological research, transgenic fruit flies are model organisms used to study the effects of genetic changes on development. Fruit flies are often preferred over other animals due to their short life cycle and low maintenance requirements.</p> <a class="btt4" href="stupid-science-gmo-thing.html"> back to main page</a>
