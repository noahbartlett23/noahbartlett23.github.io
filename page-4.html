    <p id="page-4.html" class="p3">According to the National Academy of Science, "Genetically-engineered crops are as safe to eat as their non-GE counterparts, they have no adverse environmental impacts, and they have reduced the use of pesticides." They also found that there were no adverse affects on biodiversity or danger from interbreeding between GE crops and wild relatives. The academy also found that there isn't any evidence the consumption of the GE foods currently in our food supply increase food allergies, have significant effects on the GI tract, or pose a risk for horizontal gene transfer.</p>  <a class="btt3" href="stupid-science-gmo-thing.html">back to main page</a>
